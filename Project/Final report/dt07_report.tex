\section{Introduction}
The project that we have implemented is a 2x1D filter of size 3x3 for convolution of an image of size 256x256 pixels.  

\section{Design Architecture}
%give the block design here. we need the following figure:
%a complete diagram of the processor - indicating the input and output signals, and also containing the internal blocks like the cache register,filter register, fsm_in, the multipliers, adders, mux, and fsm_out.

%here we should mention the details about the data path, bit widths etc. 
%we should give a brief explanation of each of the components in the architecture - just a couple of lines explanation should be good enough. 
%also we should explain the purpose of each of the input and output signals of the memory and the processor.

\section{Sequencing of Operations}
%explain the entire sequence in which the image is convoluted. in particular
\subsection{Memory Initialization}
%how the initialization is done - the input FSM keeps the write of the input memory till 65526 clock cycles - so all the pixels are read from the hex file.
%in the meantime, the output FSM keeps the write signal of the output memory to 1 and it is initialized with 0.
\subsection{Memory Read and Write by Processor}
%Once the initialization is done, 
% 1. the input fsm reads 3 pixels - and then waits for 9 clock cycles
% 2. the output fsm starts when the input fsm becomes idle - and runs the sequence read-idle-write 3 times.
%give picture from modelsim here showing how the two fsms synchronize.
\subsection{Memory Access Sequence}
%mention the sequence of the memory access from the input fsm and the output fsm

\section{Finite State Machines}
\subsection{Input Controller}

\subsection{Output Controller}

\section{Synthesis}
%present the results from the various reports here. 
% the critical path
% area 
% power dissipation

\section{Results}
%put the convoluted and the original image here to show the results.

\section{Discussion}
%explain how would the design change if the filter size is changed. parameters that would change:
%number of adders and multipliers.
