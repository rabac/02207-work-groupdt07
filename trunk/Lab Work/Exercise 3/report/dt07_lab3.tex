\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Retiming}
% to just explain what retiming is - the concept and its purpose. that we need to retime circuits manually - so that the synthesizer could identify two different paths easily and perform low power synthesis for the non critical path.
\subsection{Design for Division}
%explain briefly the circuit for division. mention about the critical path in the circuit.
\subsection{Division using Retiming}
%explain in detail the circuit for division using retiming. we should argue what is expected from this, and how we should be able to save power in this.
\subsection{Authors by Section}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Rajesh Bachani} 
\item \textit{Josep Renard} 
\item \textit{Markku Eerola} 
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation of Division using Retiming}
\label{section:impl}
%explain specifically the changes that were implemented for using the retimed circuit for division. this could also include parts of the VHDL, but mostly it should concentrate on highlighting the changes in terms of the connections between the components.
%we would not have any section for implementation, giving the code, since there is a lot of code in the whole thing. so we should try and just explain all the changes in the code here only.
\section{Power Report and Cell Count}
\label{section:power}
% put the reports from the power analysis here. also, give a short recap kind of a table here. also, write about the cells here.
\section{Discussion}
\label{section:discussion}
%discuss the report at length here. we should clearly justify the results, by explaining why the SVT cells count has reduced and HVT has increased, and why the cell internal power has reduced. ofcourse this was expected, but nice explanation is needed here.
